### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd speech-to-email
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd speech-to-email-backend
npm install
npm run build
npx cdk deploy
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd speech_to_email_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 4. Configure Environment
```bash
# Set your API Gateway URL
export API_BASE_URL="https://your-api-gateway-url.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod"
```

## üì± Usage

1. **Record Speech**: Tap the microphone button to start recording
2. **Upload Audio**: The app automatically uploads your recording to AWS S3
3. **Processing**: Amazon Transcribe converts speech to text
4. **Email Delivery**: The transcribed text is sent via email
5. **Confirmation**: Receive real-time updates and completion notification

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Frontend (Flutter)
```bash
API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url.com
```

#### Backend (AWS CDK)
```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=johannes.koch@gmail.com
SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### AWS Services Configuration

#### Amazon SES
```bash
# Verify sender email
aws ses verify-email-identity --email-address noreply@yourdomain.com
```

#### S3 Bucket Policies
- Audio storage bucket: Private with lifecycle policies
- Web hosting bucket: Public read access for static assets

## üß™ Testing

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd speech_to_email_app
flutter test
flutter test integration_test/
```

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd speech-to-email-backend
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

## üìä Monitoring

### CloudWatch Dashboard
Access real-time metrics at:
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=SpeechToEmailMonitoring
