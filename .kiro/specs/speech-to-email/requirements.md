# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to record speech messages through a Flutter mobile and web application, automatically convert the speech to text using AWS services, and send the transcribed content via email to a specified recipient. The system consists of a cross-platform Flutter frontend and an AWS CDK-based backend infrastructure with automated deployment through GitHub Actions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record a speech message through the Flutter app, so that I can quickly capture my thoughts without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the Flutter app THEN the system SHALL display a record button interface
2. WHEN the user taps the record button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio from the device microphone
3. WHEN the user is recording THEN the system SHALL display visual feedback indicating recording is active
4. WHEN the user taps stop recording THEN the system SHALL stop the audio recording and save it locally
5. WHEN the recording exceeds 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically stop recording and notify the user
6. IF the device microphone is not available THEN the system SHALL display an error message requesting microphone permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my recorded speech to be uploaded securely to the cloud, so that it can be processed and I don't lose my message.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes a recording THEN the system SHALL automatically upload the audio file to AWS S3
2. WHEN uploading to S3 THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication and encryption
3. WHEN the upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL display upload progress to the user
4. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times and display an error message if all attempts fail
5. WHEN the upload succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation to the user
6. WHEN the audio file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate a unique identifier for tracking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my speech to be automatically converted to text, so that the recipient receives a readable message.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio file is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger speech-to-text processing using Amazon Transcribe
2. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL store the text result in a secure location
3. IF transcription fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the user through the app
4. WHEN transcription succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed to email delivery
5. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL support common audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the transcribed text to be automatically emailed to johannes.koch@gmail.com, so that my message reaches the intended recipient without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically send an email to johannes.koch@gmail.com
2. WHEN sending the email THEN the system SHALL include the transcribed text in the email body
3. WHEN sending the email THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as timestamp and user identifier in the subject line
4. IF email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times and log the failure
5. WHEN email is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL update the user through the app with delivery confirmation
6. WHEN composing the email THEN the system SHALL format the content in a readable manner

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flutter app to work on Web, iOS, and Android platforms, so that users can access the service from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Flutter app is built THEN it SHALL compile successfully for Web, iOS, and Android targets
2. WHEN running on each platform THEN the system SHALL provide consistent user interface and functionality
3. WHEN accessing device microphone THEN the system SHALL handle platform-specific permission requests appropriately
4. WHEN running on web browsers THEN the system SHALL support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
5. IF platform-specific features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and inform the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend infrastructure to be defined using AWS CDK in TypeScript, so that the cloud resources are maintainable and version-controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use AWS CDK with TypeScript
2. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create S3 buckets, Lambda functions, SES configuration, and IAM roles
3. WHEN infrastructure is deployed THEN all resources SHALL follow AWS security best practices
4. WHEN CDK code is written THEN it SHALL be modular and well-documented
5. WHEN resources are created THEN they SHALL use appropriate naming conventions and tags

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment through GitHub Actions, so that changes can be deployed consistently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically trigger deployment
2. WHEN deploying the Flutter app THEN the system SHALL build and deploy to appropriate hosting platforms
3. WHEN deploying the backend THEN the system SHALL deploy CDK infrastructure to AWS
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities
5. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and deployment details
6. WHEN running CI/CD THEN the system SHALL include testing phases before deployment

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the transcribed text to be enhanced using AI to create a well-formatted German newspaper article, so that the content is professional and suitable for publication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL send the transcribed text to AWS Bedrock using Claude Sonnet 4
2. WHEN calling Bedrock THEN the system SHALL use a German prompt to transform the text into a newspaper article format
3. WHEN the AI processing is complete THEN the system SHALL use the enhanced article text for email delivery instead of raw transcription
4. IF Bedrock processing fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to sending the original transcribed text
5. WHEN processing with Bedrock THEN the system SHALL include appropriate German newspaper formatting (headline, paragraphs, etc.)
6. WHEN using Bedrock THEN the system SHALL handle rate limits and implement appropriate retry logic

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be handled securely and privately, so that my speech recordings and personal information are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling audio files THEN the system SHALL encrypt data in transit and at rest
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL follow data retention policies and automatically delete old recordings
3. WHEN processing speech THEN the system SHALL not store audio files longer than necessary for transcription
4. WHEN accessing AWS services THEN the system SHALL use least-privilege IAM policies
5. IF a security incident occurs THEN the system SHALL have logging and monitoring in place for detection
